Read Me Document â€” Symposium
Graham Stodolski and Drew Ward

Welcome to Symposium!

This website is meant to help you learn more about classes that interest you/you're planning to take, as well
as allow you to provide advice and/or answer questions for users looking to learn more about classes you've taken.

First, if you haven't already used Symposium, you must create an account. You can do this easily by clicking
"Register" in the top-right corner of your screen. Then, after you register, log in with your username and password.

Now that you're logged in, you'll notice that you have no courses on your homepage! Let's fix that by clicking
the "Add" button located in the menu bar. Simply enter the information for whatever class you want to add
(like "CPSC 100" or "Introduction to Computing and Programming" for CS50) and click the yellow "Add" button.
You should now see CS50's information in your My Courses table!

If you'd like to search up the information of a specific course, you can use the "Search" page in the menu bar.
Simply input either the course subject and number or its name, hit "Search", and view the rest of its information!

If you'd like to remove a course from your My Courses table, navigate to the Remove page by clicking the "Remove"
button in menu bar. Just like before, enter the course's information, click the "Remove" button, and it will
be removed. Do make sure that course is already in your My Courses table!

For the purposes of this implementation, Symposium only allows you to add/search/remove these 10 courses:
CPSC 100
MATH 115
ACCT 270
AFAM 160
CHEM 220
ECON 360
MB&B 743
PHYS 107
ZULU 140
CPSC 201

You'll notice that each course's name in your My Courses table is a link. Click this and it will redirect you
to that course's specific forum page. There may or may not already be posts there from other users, offering their
opinions on or asking questions about that course. If you'd like to post, type in whatever you'd like to say at
the bottom and click "Submit". You should see you post, with your username and a timestamp, pop up above!
