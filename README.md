# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Symposium

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Yale-specific forum geared towards students to ask questions or post advice for a specific class.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The backbone of the project is a SQL database, storing all necessary information about classes, professors, users, etc.
We will use Python for Flask, Javascript to allow for interactive features, and HTML and CSS to make and style the website.
Just like Coursetable supplements Course Search for students, Symposium hopes to supplement Online Course Evaluation, focusing on the needs of and features most useful for Yalies.
These features will include open forum pages for each course, a way to indicate/follow users' past classes, and an intuitive and user-friendly UI.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
